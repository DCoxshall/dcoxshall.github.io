                    This site started as a few HTML documents on GitHub pages.
                    Then I decided I wanted to learn frontend development, and
                    attempted to shoehorn React into it. Then I decided I wanted
                    to learn how web apps were deployed, so I rented a server
                    and served my React pages from there. Then I decided I
                    wanted to learn full-stack development, so I added Django to
                    the mix, serving pages up dynamically to a React frontend.
                    Then I decided that there wasn't enough shit JavaScript code
                    in circulation, so I swapped out the Django for a Node.js
                    backend. Then I realised that I didn't need any of that,
                    because I'm still only serving static HTML pages.

                    Essentially, it took me 3 years to realise that to achieve a
                    goal, the less software you need to write, the better.
