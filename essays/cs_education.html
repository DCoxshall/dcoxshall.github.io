                    Computer science students are bad at computer science...
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I arrived at university, I had expected to immediately
                    be surrounded by young people who were at least as good as I
                    am, when it comes to technology. Not that I'm some kind of
                    benchmark - I just underestimated how interested in
                    computers the average computer science student would be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And you know what? I can understand that. I can understand
                    not having an active interest in your degree. I get that
                    writing code for 12 hours a day is perhaps not to everyone's
                    taste. I get that. But I had kind of expected people to have
                    basic IT skils. I had expected people to be able to do
                    things like navigate a Linux shell, to be able to change
                    environment variables on Windows, to be able to install
                    software without needing a lecturers help.
                </p>
                <p>But they can't.</p>
                <p>
                    As I'm writing this, I've just finished a module involving
                    development of a full-stack application, with Spring Boot on
                    the backend and Angular on the frontend. I've never used
                    either of those frameworks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And to be fair, the module was designed to account for that.
                    Spring and Angular were wrapped up in a nice little piece of
                    malware called JHipster, which is a "tool" designed to help
                    web developers prototype applications as quickly as
                    possible. If you're an experienced dev in need a quick MVP,
                    I imagine JHipster can be quite useful.
