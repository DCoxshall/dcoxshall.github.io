            <p>Computer science is a difficult course to teach. Technology moves quickly. This means that often,
                institutions are forced to choose between teaching computer fundamentals, risking presenting students
                with content that's out-of-date, and teaching modern programming languages and techniques, which will
                likely be out of date by the time students are entering the work force.</p>
