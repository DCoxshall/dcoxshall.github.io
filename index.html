            <p>I'm a computer science student. This is my personal site. You may note it is excessively simple - this is
                partly because I'm not good enough at front-end development to make it look any better, but mostly
                because it doesn't <em>need</em> to have any more complicated.</p>
            <p>I feel that the fastest and most reliable technologies are those that don't exist. <s>That's why there's
                    fucking nothing on this website.</s> </p>
